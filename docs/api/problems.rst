Direct support of different problems
------------------------------------

.. py:currentmodule:: drudge

In addition to the algebraic rules, more domain specific knowledge can be added
to drudge subclasses for the convenience of working on specific problems.  In
these :py:class:`Drudge` subclasses, we have not only the general mathematical
knowledge like commutation rules, but more detailed information about the
problem as well, like some commonly used ranges, dummies.
