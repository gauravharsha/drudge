class Range:
    """A symbolic range that can be summed over.

    This class is for symbolic ranges that is going to be summed over in
    tensors.  Each range should have a label, and optionally lower and upper
    bounds, which should be both given or absent.  The label can be any hashable
    and ordered Python type.  The bounds will not be directly used for symbolic
    computation, but rather designed for printers and conversion to SymPy
    summation.  Note that ranges are assumed to be atomic and disjoint.  Even in
    the presence of lower and upper bounds, unequal ranges are assumed to be
    disjoint.

    .. warning::

        Equality comparison and hashing of ranges are *completely* based on the
        label, without consideration of the bounds.  So ranges with the same
        label but different bounds will be considered equal.  This is to
        facilitate the usage of a same dummy set for ranges with slight
        variation in the bounds.

    .. warning::

         Unequal ranges are always assumed to be disjoint.
